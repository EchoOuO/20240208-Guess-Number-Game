# Guess-Number Game Project

This personal project demonstrates how to build a simple website for a guess-number game. It highlights the use of semantic HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5**: Ensures the structure of the webpage is clear and meaningful.
- **CSS Styling**: Provides a clean and responsive design for the game interface.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Implements the core game functionality, allowing users to input guesses and receive feedback.
